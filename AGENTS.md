# Repository Guidelines

- Use 4 spaces for indentation in Python and shell scripts.
- Ensure all text files end with a newline.
- After editing Python sources, run `python -m py_compile get_new_packages.py`.
- Attempt to run `make all` to build repository metadata. It's okay if it fails due to missing tools.
